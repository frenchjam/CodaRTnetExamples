				Packets received on the stream and not yet retrieved using
				this function are buffered up to the system default
				UDP receive-buffer limit.  On windows XP systems that default 
				limit is 8192 bytes.  Once this buffer is full, any additional
				packets received will be lost.

				If there are no packets available when this function is called,
				it will block whilst waiting for new data, for up to the 
				maximum number of microseconds specified in the timeoutusec parameter.
				To block indefinitely use the symbolic constant
				CODANET_PACKET_WAIT_INDEFINITELY.

				@param packet Reference to an RTNetworkPacket object which will
				              be filled with new data on successful completion.
				@param timeoutusec Maximum time to block whilst waiting for a new
				                   data packet (microseconds), or CODANET_PACKET_WAIT_INDEFINITELY to
													 wait indefinitely.
			  @retval CODANET_OK Packet was received ok .
				@retval CODANET_STREAMTIMEOUT timeoutusec was reached before any data packets were received.
				@retval CODANET_SOCKETERROR_BROKEN Stream connection was broken.
