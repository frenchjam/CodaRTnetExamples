	   Summary
	   Provides the main programming interface for commuication with
	   Codamotion RTNet Server.
	   
	   Description
	   Use doAutoDiscoverServer to discover available servers on the
	   network and connect to establish a connection. startSystem
	   initialises devices (start mode), and prepareForAcq prepares
	   devices for acquisition (prepared mode). Attach data streams
	   for receving data by using createDataStream. When in prepared
	   mode, a single frame of data can be requested from all
	   devices with doSingleShotAcq. To continuously stream data use
	   startAcqContinuous. To continously buffer data use
	   startAcqContinousBuffered. Whilst in buffered acquisition
	   mode the most recently acquired frame can be monitored using
	   requestAcqBufferPacket                                        */
