/**codanet_cmd_startup
	 Summary
   Start hardware and perform initialisation
   
   Description
   This command is usually executed at the beginning of any
   program using the system. If the system has already been
   started then it will give a successful outcome and will <I>not</I>

   clear some unresolved hardware errors on a device) then you
   should call codanet_cmd_shutdown followed by
   codanet_cmd_startup.
   
	 A valid hardware config handle must be passed to this function.
	 The list of all available hardware configs can be obtained
	 using codanet_hwconfig_enumerate.  

	 The purpose of a hardware config is that some devices may 
	 have pre-startup options which can be
   configured prior to startup, usually to enable or disable
   certain components. For example Codamotion CX1 units can be
   enabled or disabled, and different digital force plates
   selected.
