	/** Summary
	    Decodes 16-bit measurement data received from a data stream.

			Description
			Use this class to decode network packets which are in the <b>ADC16</b> 
			format.  This is the format used to transmit measurements from 16-bit analog-to-digital
			converters such as the GS16AIO on a Codamotion Active Hub.  They contain
			one 16-bit value per channel of analog data, for several channels.  However, devices may
			have elected to decimate one or more channels, in which case the values corresponding
			to those channels are ommitted for all packets whose device tick value is not a
			multiple of the decimation factor.  When using the results from this decoder,
			it is therefore important to know the channel decimation factors which were applied
			in order to correctly identify which channel is which.

			Note that decimation factors are only applied to packets received
			using RTNetClient::startAcqContinuous or RTNetClient::requestAcqBufferFrame
			and <I>not</I> when received using RTNetClient::doAcqSingleShot or
			RTNetClient::monitorAcqBuffer.
